          Pong is a table tennisâ€“themed twitch arcade sports video game,
          featuring simple two-dimensional graphics, manufactured by Atari and
          originally released in <span>1972</span>. It was one of the earliest
          arcade video games; it was created by <span>Allan Alcorn</span> as a
          training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell,
          but Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney were surprised by the
          quality of Alcorn's work and decided to manufacture the game.
